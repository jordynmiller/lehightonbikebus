# Student Benefits of Safe Routes to School
Numerous studies have documented that Safe Routes to School projects and programs can lead to increased walking and bicycling activity among students. But why is it important for communities to make it safer and more convenient for students to walk and bike to school?
- Increased Safety for Students
- Reduction in Absences and Tardiness
- Healthier Students
- Improved Academic Performance
- Cleaner Air, Fewer Asthma Complications
- Greater Confidence
- Stronger Social Connections

# Community Benefits
Students and their families are not the only ones who benefit when we encourage and enable young people to walk or bike to school safely. In many ways, Safe Routes to School benefits the whole community. Communities that prioritize active transportation can see improvements such as:
- Reduced Traffic Congestion
- Stronger Sense of Community
- Safer Streets
- Lower Costs
- Improved Accessibility
- Economic Gains
