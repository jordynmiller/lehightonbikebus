Before setting out for the bike bus, use the following checklist to ensure bikes fit their riders, bikes are in good shape for the ride, and that all safety guidelines are followed.

## Check helmet fit
Children under 12 years of age are <u>**required**</u> to wear a helmet when riding a bike in Pennsylvania.

## Check bike fit
Students will be safest and most comfortable on bikes that fit them
at their current size, not ones that they will “grow into.”
- When standing over the bicycle, there should be 1 to 2
inches between the rider and the top tube (bar) if using a
road bike and 3 to 4 inches if using a mountain bike.
- When sitting on the bike, the rider should be able to touch
the ground with both feet.

## Check bike condition using the ABC quick check
It is important to make sure that bicycles are in good operating condition before any ride. The ABC Quick Check is an inspection approach that encourages review of Air, Brakes, Chain, and Quick release parts, all of which should be inspected and in good working condition before each ride.

- Air – Check the air pressure, spin the wheels, and make sure the tires are not worn out.
- Brakes – Check to make sure coaster brakes will stop the bike by spinning the back wheel and applying the
brake. If the bike has hand brakes, check to see that the levers don’t hit the handlebars when squeezed. Lift
one tire up at a time and spin it; squeeze the levers to see if the tire stops. The brake pads should be clean,
straight, and contact the rims properly.
- Cranks, Chains, and Cogs – Grab the crank arms and try to wiggle side to side. There should be no move-
ment. Spin the pedals and cranks to see if the chain drives the rear wheel. The chain should look like
metal, not rust or black gunk. If the bike has gears, check to make sure the gear levers and derailleurs
(gear-changing mechanism) work to shift the chain between gears.
- Quick Release – Some bikes have quick releases on the wheels or the seat post. Check to make sure they
are tight and closed properly.
- Check – After making sure the seat and handlebars are tight and the proper height, ride your bicycle
around the driveway or parking lot and check that everything works well.

## Bike safety and comfort accessories:
- Check that bicycles have reflectors on the front, back and both wheels. If riding when it’s dark or nearly dark, there should also be white headlights and red taillights.
- Riders should have a bike lock to secure their bicycle once arriving at the school. U-locks are preferred over cable locks, which can be easily cut. Attach the frame and front wheel of the bike to the bike rack.
- To help transport backpacks and other bulky items, consider if bike baskets, saddle bags, or some other cargo carrier could help.
